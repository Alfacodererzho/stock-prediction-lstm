# Stock Price Prediction

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Structure


- **data_preprocessing.py**: Gathers and preprocesses the data (scaling, sequence creation).
- **model.py**: Builds the neural network architecture (LSTM).
- **train.py**: Trains the neural network and saves the model weights.
- **predict.py**: Loads the trained model and runs predictions on test or new data.
- **main.py**: Example “entry point” to orchestrate the process end-to-end.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project (for example):

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Update ticker symbols and date ranges in `data_preprocessing.py` or pass them in as command-line arguments (extend code if needed).
2. Adjust hyperparameters in `model.py` or `train.py` if desired.
3. Trained weights are saved in the local directory (or a sub-directory). 
4. Use `predict.py` to generate predictions on new data or the test dataset.

## Notes

- This is a demonstration project. Real-world stock price prediction is complex and involves additional data (volume, technical indicators, macro data, sentiment analysis, etc.).
- Always validate your model on out-of-sample data (e.g., rolling window or walk-forward validation).
