# Stock Price Prediction

🚀 **Predict stock prices with an LSTM neural network using historical data!**

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Prepares data (scaling, sequence creation).
- **`model.py`**: Defines the LSTM architecture.
- **`train.py`**: Trains the model and saves weights.
- **`predict.py`**: Predicts stock prices using the trained model.
- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the process end-to-end.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 📖 Usage

1. **Set Parameters**:
    - Update ticker symbols and date ranges in `data_preprocessing.py`.
    - Optionally, pass these as command-line arguments (extend code if required).

2. **Adjust Model Settings**:
    - Modify hyperparameters in `model.py` or `train.py`.

3. **Train & Save**:
    - Trained weights will be saved in the specified directory.

4. **Predict**:
    - Use `predict.py` for predictions on new or test data.

## 📝 Notes

- **Complexity**: Real-world stock prediction often requires additional data, such as:
  - Volume
  - Technical indicators
  - Macroeconomic data
  - Sentiment analysis

- **Validation**: Always validate your model with out-of-sample data using techniques like rolling windows or walk-forward validation.
